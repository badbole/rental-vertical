Rental Routing Shipment Plan

Description
-----------

Usually, rental products are deliverd from the rental_in location of the rental company
to a rental_out location at the renting customer. However, this can be optimized in
certain situations, when it is more appropriate to ship the product from one customer
to the next customer.
