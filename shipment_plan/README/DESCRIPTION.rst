Shipment Management

Description
-----------

This module provides the base of the shipment management in order to organize and manage transportation
for products that are to voluminous or heavy or somehow dangerous, and therefore need special transport treatment.
The shipment plans focus on the transport after leaving or before entering the internal stock locations.
