Description
-----------

This module provides a rental extension for the shipment management.
Rentals require two deliveries, one to transfer the products to the customer and one to get them back.
In case of products that needs special transportation, e.g. because of their weight, height or chemical
properties, two shipment plans are created when requesting transportation from the rental order.
