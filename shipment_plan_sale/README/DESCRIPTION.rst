Shipment Management Sale

Description
-----------

This module provides a sale extension for the shipment management.
The combination of a storable product that needs transportation and the use of an incoterm configured for outbound
transportation allows the salesmen to create a transport request (purchase order or requisition) directly from the
sale order. It will also create the shipment plan.
